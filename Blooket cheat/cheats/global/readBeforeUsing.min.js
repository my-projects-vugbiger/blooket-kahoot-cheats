Therefore, Use Any Blook, Every Answer Correct, Remove Random Name, and all Auto Answer scripts will be broken on the modes. The only one that can kinda be fixed is Auto Answer. In Intervals, there is a set of learnAutoAnswer scripts that learn the answers before solving them. Use them in all modes except Fishing Frenzy and Crypto Hack.");
